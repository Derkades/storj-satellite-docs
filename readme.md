# Storj satellite documentation

## Software and dependencies

Copy the `docker-compose.yaml` file from the repo and optionally adjust some parameters.

For the satellite version tag, go to https://hub.docker.com/r/storjlabs/satellite/tags and use the search box to find the tag for the latest stable release (these correspond which storage node version numbers, see the github releases page)

Start the satellite to generate folders and configuration files. It will crash because it's not configured yet.

Use `docker-compose up -d` to start everything

Use `docker-compose stop` to stop the containers and `docker-compose logs -f` to view the logs.

## Identity

TODO

## Satellite database settings

In the satellite data folder, edit `satellite/config.yaml`.

* `database` should be set to `postgres://postgres:YOURPASSWORD@postgres/satellite?sslmode=disable`
* `live-accounting.storage-backend` should be set to `redis://redis:6379?db=0`
* `server.revocation-dburl` can be left default (sqlite database)

Now, enable the environment variable `SATELITE_MIGRATE` and let the satellite create the databases. This env var should also be enabled when upgrading to a newer version.

The logs should show something like this:

```log
INFO    Configuration loaded    {"Location": "/root/.local/share/storj/satellite/config.yaml"}
INFO    migration.migrate.105   [...]
[...]
INFO    migration.migrate.112   [...]
INFO    migration.migrate       Database Version        {"version": 112}
```

Now, restart the satellite without `SATELLITE_MIGRATE`

## Unanswered questions

* How to get nodes to use this satellite?
* How to "access" the satellite for users and admins, I think there should be some web interface like europe-west-1.tardigrade.io?
